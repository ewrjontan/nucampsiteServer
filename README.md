# nucampsiteServer

## Description

This is a back-end server created for my Nucamp class to be used in conjunction with the React and React-Native applications that we built earlier during our bootcamp. 
The server was built using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.

## Usage

The server provides GET, POST, PUT and DELETE endpoints for the following tasks:
- User registration, login/logout and authentication
- Fetching campsites, promotions and partners
- Marking campsites as a "favorite"
